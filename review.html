  <h1>Hosts Review</h1>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.bluehost.com">Blue Host</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>I like this because </li>
        <li>2.95 dollars a month</li>
        <li>Has a weird pictiure of a dude on the home page</li>
        <li>Makes WordPress fun and easy</li>
      </ul>
    <p>I am not picking this because I do not like paying for things that are free. </p>

<h2> <a href="https://fatcow.com">Fatcow</a></h2>
    <ul>
      <li>I like this because </li>
      <li>4.08 dollars a month</li>
      <li>Says it has free domain name, but makes me pay for it</li>
      <li>Has fun cartoon look</li>
    </ul>
  <p>I am not picking this because it looks like this was made for kids, and I want a professional website.</p>

<h2> <a href="https://wix.com">Blue Host</a></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Shows different themes</li>
    <li>Free</li>
    <li>Says it is secure</li>
    <li>Shows how many people use this</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I am picking this because with it being free and the overall design of the interface looks more inviting. </p>
