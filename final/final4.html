            <p>Andrew is an interesting character. He is the professor I've had the pleasure of being in class with the most here. He has a wife and a child... yes that is how he refers to them. He likes collecting rocks, working on cars and his motorcycle. He used to work at Tech then he came here. He also used to work at a law firm for a while out of college. It took him a while but he finally wamred up to me and now I actually enjoy his class.</p>
