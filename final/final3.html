            <p>Reyerson was one of my first professors here that helped me settle into Carroll. She would always make sure I was doing my work on time and would make sure I was doing okay. She quickly became my advisor and has helped me made sure I will graduate on time. Without her I would probably not be doing this well here. </p>
