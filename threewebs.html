  <h1>Sports Website Reviews</h1>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.espn.com">ESPN</a></h2>

    <p>Entertainment and Sports Networking Program, also known as EPSN, is a very well developed site. They have been a company since 1979 and have run sports networking ever since. The main thing I like about their website is how up to date it is with current events. They have multiple tabs (colums) of sports you can pick form and an 'other' tab that has multiple options. The thing I like the most is how it tracks what you like most and shows you that information first and then goes down the line from there. Espn has been at the top of the sports world forever and I think their website is the reason they stay at the top. One thing I really like about the website is when you read an article there is an article underneath that is similar to what you were just reading. Something I might change is maybe not having so much going on. They have highlight videos, articles on articles, and more things that make the page pop, just a little too much. I also like how the tabs on the top move down the page with you so you can always click them without scrolling. Overall this is probably my favorite website to visit on a daily basis just because of how accesible it is and I understand it's setup the best. </p>

  <h2> <a href="https://bleacherreport.com">Bleacher Report</a></h2>

  <p>For my next site I picked Bleacher Report. Bleacher Report is a source for sports news that has recently come into the limelight because of social media. Bleacher Report is a site that is basically ESPN but a little differnt in the way that they go about their website. They are heavily social media based, so much so that they have a 'trending' tab on their homepage that comes directly from twitter. They base their whole persona on social media. They aren't a website based company, if that makes sense. They base everything they do on social media, but still have a better website than the last company I picked. I like how relevant and up to date Bleacher Report is because it is what people want now. One thing I don't like is how much scrolling you have to do to find specific things. All of their picture are super big and take up a lot of space, but it catches readers eyes a lot better than ESPN does. Overall they just aren't as advanced as ESPN in coverage but they know what they do well so they stick with it. </p>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.cbssports.com">CBS Sports</a></h2>

  <p>The website I liked the least was CBS sports. I understand that CBS is by no means a sports first program, but they have to understand that is where a lot of the money is. I don't like how the website is not ordered at all. All of the pictures that are hyper links to artciles are all different sizes. Now I get that that could serve a purpose in that they want things to be more emphisized, but there does not seem to be any rhyme or reason behind what is bigger vs smaller. They also have a lot of adds which just does not look good to me as a consumer at all. They have all the building blocks to be an average sports news websites but they just dont exictue well enough to be seen as a good one to me. It is not as much scrolling as Bleacher Report, but they all share the same information. Something I also like is how the top tabs do stay at the top of the screen while you're scrolling so you don't have to keep scrolling to the top to select items. Overall this just isn't a site I would go to for information because of how unorganized it is.  </p>

  <p> These are all good websites and give pretty much all the same basic information, they just have different writers and different means of doing things. </p>
