  <h1><i>States Websites</i></h1>

  <h2> <a href="https://www.nebraska.gov">Best State Website</a></h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bright colors that are fun to look at</li>
        <li>Charts: I dont know what for, but they make me intrested</li>
        <li>Easy to use menu</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Overall just a fun website to look at and navigate. Has a lot of information without shoving it in your face or making it hard to find.</p>

    <h2> <a href="https://delaware.gov">2nd Coolest</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A lot of information without having to look too hard</li>
          <li>Heavy on the scrolling on the main page</li>
          <li>Not very fun colors</li>
        </ul>
      <p>Just simple and easy, nothing too fancy or bland.</p>

    <h2> <a href="https://www.illinois.gov">The Middle</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Yes, I understand covid is still a thing</li>
          <li>I like the virtual assistant</li>
          <li>Easy to use menu</li>
        </ul>
      <p>I like the layout of this website a lot, but it has very dull colors and not many interesting things on the face.</p>

    <h2> <a href="https://alaska.gov">Not the Worst One</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Has some options to pick from and a search bar</li>
          <li>I do not want to follow any politician on social media</li>
          <li>Looks like it was designed in 2008 and was never redone</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This page isn't the worst to navigate, it is just very bland and unappealing.</p>

    <h2><a href="https://www.myflorida.com">Should be Completly Re-done</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>I don't like just the search bar on the home screen</li>
          <li>The picture is kind of cool</li>
          <li>There are 3 tabs on the top of the page and none of them are useful</li>
        </ul>
      <p>This whole thing needs a facelife, except the super cool picture on the front home page</p>
